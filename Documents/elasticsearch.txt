•	Near real-time distributed and analytics engine
•	Requests are fulfilled with RESTful API
•	Open source developed in Java
•	All based on text documents (i.e. JSON), instead of SCHEMAS
•	Analysis: It provides aggregations which helps you to zoom out to explore trends and patterns in your data


Cluster: 
A cluster is a collection of nodes that hold the entire data. It provides centralized indexing and search capabilities across all nodes and is identified by a unique name (by default it is “elasticsearch”).


Node:
A node is a single server which is a part of a cluster, stores data and participates in the cluster’s indexing and search capabilities. 


Index:
An index is a collection of documents with similar characteristics and is identified by a name. The name is used to refer to the index while performing indexing, search, update, and delete operations.


Type:

A type is a logical category of in index. It is defined for documents that have a set of common fields. You can define more than one type in your index. 


Document:

A document is a basic unit of information which can be indexed. It is expressed in JSON.


Shards:

Elasticsearch provides the ability to subdivide the index into multiple pieces called shards. Each shard is itself a fully-functional and independent “index”.


Replicas:

Replicas are the copies of your index’s shards.

API Conventions


Multiple Indices:
•	Comma separated notations (demo1, demo2, demo3)
•	Wildcard notations (“*” matches with one or more characters in text; “+” is the same as the previous character; “_all keyword” for all indices)
•	Elasticsearch lets you search indices according to date and time:
    <static_name{date_math_expr{date_format | time_zone}}>



Elasticsearch API’s:
•	Document API’s: To perform operations on the documents
•	Search API’s: Perform search
•	Aggregation
•	Index API’s: To perform operations on the index level
•	Cluster API’s
